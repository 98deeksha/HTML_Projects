This is a simple game build only using html.
The game expects the user to guess the number it has selected between 0 to 100.
Every time you guess a number, it'll tell if the number you have guessed to higher or lower than the actual number, based on that the user
can keep guessing. 

Note : Keep the console open when you are playing the game
